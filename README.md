### ES6 Features Used

1. **Arrow Functions (=>):**

   - Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions and automatically bind this context, which is useful in callback functions and event handlers.

1. **let and const Keywords:**

   - ES6 introduces block-scoped variable declarations with let and const instead of var, improving readability and avoiding variable hoisting issues.

1. **Template Literals (Backticks ``):**

   - Template literals allow easier string interpolation and multi-line strings using backticks.

1. **Destructuring Assignment:**

   - Destructuring allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables, simplifying code.

1. **Default Parameters:**

   - Default function parameters allow you to define default values for function arguments.

1. **Promises:**

   - Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in a cleaner, more readable way than traditional callback functions.

1. **Classes:**

   - ES6 provides a more readable syntax for defining classes and dealing with inheritance.

1. **for...of Loop:**
   - The for...of loop provides a simpler and cleaner way to iterate over arrays and other iterable objects.
